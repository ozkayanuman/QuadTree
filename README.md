# QuadTree

A simple collision detection system. Includes two algorithms:

Brute checks all bodies against all other bodies, and it can be hard on performance and only recommended for 100 or less bodies.
QuadTree queries a QuadTree to test collisions against nearby bodies only. Much more performant than Brute, but takes a bit of extra work to set up.
